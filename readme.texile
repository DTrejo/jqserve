h1. jqserve

Use jqserve to serve files after running them through whatever jquery code you desire. You'll won't have to think about templating languages, and your designer won't need to fire up a dev server in order to write html and css! Note: this is probably not ready for production.

<pre>jqserve(request, response, 'index.html', function(err, $){
	$('</p>').text('hey dude').appendTo('body');
});</pre> will attempt to serve a file from your ./public folder using after modifying it with <code>$('</p>').text('hey dude').appendTo('body')</code>.

<pre>jqserve(request, response, 'index.html')</pre> will attempt to serve a file from your ./public folder using node-static.
